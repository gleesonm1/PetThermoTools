==============================
Introduction and Citation
==============================

Welcome to pyMELTScalc- An Open-Source python3 tool for performing phase equilibria calculations in igneous system.

This tool is under development. You can currently cite the zenodo repository for pyMELTScalc: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/536711798 

==============================
Units
==============================

pyMELTScalc performs all calculations using  Celsuis for temperature and bar for Pressure. Major element contents should be in wt%.


==============================
Reporting bugs/issues with the code
==============================
No software is free of bugs, particularly when still in the early stages of development! Many of the calculations performed in pyMELTScalc have been benchmarked to the results obtained by alternative MELTS software packages (e.g., MELTS for Excel). However, if users spot any bugs, or wish to request features, they should submit an 'issue' on the GitHub page. Alternatively, they can email the development team. In both cases, please upload any files the code is using (e.g. excel, jupyter notebooks) so that I can run your code to see what the issue is!
