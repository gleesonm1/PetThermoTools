Introduction and Citation
==============================

Welcome to pyMELTScalc- An Open-Source python3 tool for performing phase equilibria calculations in igneous system.

This tool is under development. You can currently cite the zenodo repository for pyMELTScalc: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/536711798 

==============================
Units
==============================

pyMELTScalc performs all calculations using  Celsuis for temperature and bar for Pressure. Major element contents should be in wt%.

Reporting bugs/issues with the code
==============================
No software is free of bugs, particularly when new features are being constantly added. We have extensively benchmarked pyMELTScalc to existing spreadsheets, and before the package is published on PyPI, automatic unit tests are run through GitHub in the attempt to catch problems introduced by changing Python dependencies/updates. However, if users spot any bugs, or wish to request features, they should submit an 'issue' on the GitHub page. Alternatively, they can email the author team. In both cases, please upload any files the code is using (e.g. excel, jupyter notebooks) so that I can run your code to see what the issue is!
